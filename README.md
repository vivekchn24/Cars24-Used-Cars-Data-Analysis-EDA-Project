# Cars24-Used-Cars-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Cars24 dataset, which contains information about used cars listed for sale. The goal was to analyze trends in car pricing, usage, and factors influencing resale value.

## **🍽️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Cars24 Used Car Dataset :-**

This dataset is a collection of used cars that are registered on Cars24 Platform. In this dataset, we have more than 50000 rows and 17 columns, a fairly large dataset. You will be able to get hands-on experience while performing the following tasks and will be able to understand how real-world problem statement analysis is done.

## **-->> 📁 Dataset**

- ""Source"": Cars24 Used Cars public dataset (Downloaded from Kaggle / official source)
- ""Rows"": Aprrox 50,000+
- ""Columns"": 17+ (various Restaurants & Restaurants Types,Payment details,etc.)

## **-->> 📂 Cars24-Used-Cars-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project Folder Contains**

- ZOMATO_DATA_ANALYSIS_EDA_PROJECT_VIVEK_CHAUHAN (PowerPoint Presentation Slides Pdf File)
- DATA CSV FOLDER CONTAINS ORIGINAL DATASET


## **📌 Key Objectives :-**

- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers if needed, and formatting categorical variables
- Analyzed features like year of purchase, fuel type, transmission, seller type, and car brand/model & car manufacturing year
- Explored the impact of kilometers driven, ownership status, and engine capacity on the selling price
- Visualized relationships between features using bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps

## **🔧 Tools & Technologies Used :-**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

## **📌 Key Steps Performed In EDA Analysis**

1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
   - Formatting and type conversion

2. Univariate Analysis
   - Distributions of loan amount, interest rates, term, grades

3. Bivariate Analysis
   - Loan status vs interest rate, loan purpose, etc.

4. Multivariate Analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Factors affecting loan defaults

5. Insights & Conclusions
   - Summarized key findings with visual charts
   - Business recommendations

**🎯 Outcome :-**

- Through this EDA project, I gained valuable experience in understanding real-world vehicle resale data, identifying influential factors, and building a foundation for future predictive modeling (e.g., car km driven,most selling model etc.prediction).
