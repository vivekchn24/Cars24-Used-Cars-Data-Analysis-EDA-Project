# Cars24-Used-Cars-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Cars24 dataset, which contains information about used cars listed for sale. The goal was to analyze trends in car pricing, usage, and factors influencing resale value.

## **üçΩÔ∏è Exploratory Data Analysis on Cars24 Used Car Dataset :-**

This dataset is a collection of used cars that are registered on Cars24 Platform. In this dataset, we have more than 50000 rows and 17 columns, a fairly large dataset. You will be able to get hands-on experience while performing the following tasks and will be able to understand how real-world problem statement analysis is done.

## **üìÅ Dataset**

- ""Source"": Cars24 Used Cars public dataset (Downloaded from Kaggle / official source)
- ""Rows"": Aprrox 1400+
- ""Columns"": 10+ (various Cars & Cars-Model-Names,KM driven-details,etc.)

## **üìÇ Cars24-Used-Cars-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project Folder Contains**

- Cars24_DATA_ANALYSIS_EDA_PROJECT_VIVEK_CHAUHAN (Jupyter Notebook Code Pdf File)
- Cars24_DATA_ANALYSIS_EDA_PROJECT_VIVEK_CHAUHAN (PowerPoint Presentation Slides Pdf File)
- DATA CSV FOLDER CONTAINS ORIGINAL DATASET


## **üìå Key Objectives :-**

- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers if needed, and formatting categorical variables
- Analyzed features like year of purchase, fuel type, transmission, seller type, and car brand/model & car manufacturing year
- Explored the impact of kilometers driven, ownership status, and engine capacity on the selling price
- Visualized relationships between features using bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps

## **üîß Tools & Technologies Used :-**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

## **üìå Key Steps Performed In EDA Analysis**

1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
   - Formatting and type conversion

2. Univariate Analysis
   - Distributions of Imperfections, Cars-Ownership, Spare-Key

3. Bivariate Analysis
   - Cars-Ownership vs Imperfections, Imperfections, etc.

4. Multivariate Analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Factors affecting loan defaults

5. Insights & Conclusions
   - Summarized key findings with visual charts
   - Business recommendations

## **üéØ Outcome :-**

- Through this EDA project, I gained valuable experience in understanding real-world vehicle resale data, identifying influential factors, and building a foundation for future predictive modeling (e.g., car km driven,most selling model etc.prediction).

## **üìã Final EDA Insights and Recommendations :-** 

1) Verify Ownership and Spare Key Availability

- Always ensure that the spare key is available, especially for mid-aged cars and first-owner cars. A significant percentage of older cars or those with imperfections may not come with a spare key, so check this before making a purchase.
 
2) Car Age Considerations:

- Mid-aged cars tend to have higher resale value and maintain better condition. Consider mid-aged cars over very old cars as they are usually in better shape. Be cautious with older petrol cars as they might have more imperfections.

3) Fuel Type Considerations:

- Petrol cars are the most popular on the platform and are often low-running. However, they tend to have more imperfections. Carefully inspect petrol cars for any flaws.
- Diesel and CNG cars are typically medium-running and are more likely to have automatic transmission. Choose automatic transmission cars if that‚Äôs your preference.

4) Engine Capacity and Transmission Type:

- Most cars have medium engine capacity (cc). Petrol cars often fall into this category. If you want higher performance, look for medium cc engine cars.
- Manual transmission is common in petrol cars, while diesel and CNG cars generally feature automatic transmission. Choose based on your driving style and preference.

5) Repainted Parts:

- Check the repainted parts of the car, as petrol-driven cars often have medium repainted parts. Excessive repainting may indicate prior accidents or repairs. Inspect the car's condition thoroughly before buying.¬∂

6) Running Distance (KM):

- Low-running (KM) cars are more desirable as they tend to have a longer lifespan. Look for low KM cars to ensure better condition and longevity.
- Medium KM cars, especially diesel and CNG cars, are still reliable options, so don‚Äôt overlook them if you‚Äôre seeking a dependable vehicle.

7) Brand Preferences:

- Maruti cars manufactured in 2012 or later are some of the highest-selling models on the platform. If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable car, Maruti is a solid choice.

8) Imperfections in Petrol Cars:

- Petrol cars generally have higher imperfections compared to other fuel types. If you are considering a petrol car, ensure that the imperfections are not too severe.

9) Repainted Parts and Spare Key Availability:

- Cars with medium-level repainted parts are more likely to have a spare key. These cars are often in better condition, so consider them if you prioritize having a spare key.

10) Mileage Considerations:

- First-owner cars typically have better maintenance records and lower running KM. Look for first-owner cars as they tend to be well-maintained, offering better long-term value.
